LazyDays.java is an old project as part of an assignment for my Fundamentals of Programming I class.

Requirements from the assignment:

Activities at Lake LazyDays 

As activity directory at Lake LazyDays Resort, it is your job to suggest appropriate activities to guests based on the weather: 
temp >= 80:  swimming 
60 <= temp < 80:   tennis 
40 <= temp < 60:   golf 
temp < 40:  skiing 

1. Write a program that prompts the user for a temperature, then prints out the activity appropriate for that temperature. Use 
a cascading if, and be sure that your conditions are no more complex than necessary. 

2. Modify your program so that if the temperature is greater than 95 or less than 20, it prints “Visit our shops!”. (Hint: Use 
a boolean operator in your condition.) For other temperatures print the activity as before.
